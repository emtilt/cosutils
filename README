This is intended to house utilities for coadding and using COS data. It is forked from Nico Nell's python port of Charles Danforth's IDL code (the latter of which had many other contributors, too, most notably Brain Keeney but also myself, to a small degree)

Nico Nell's original README is preserved below:


## python-coaddx1d

This is a python translation of Charles Danforth's coaddx1d IDL
routine. This program provides the same capabilities as the IDL
coaddx1d routine. The coaddition provides three save file formats of
dat csv and a python pickle file (the equivalent of idl save files --
that is, the ability to save the python spectrum object). There are
also two convenient plotting routines for easy creation of plots of
the entire coadded spectrum.


## Intsallation

Dependencies:
python >= 2.5
numpy
scipy
pyfits
idlsave
matplotlib

Installation is simple and accomplished by the command:

python setup.py install

Alternatively for installing in a different location one can use:

python setup.py --root="/some/directory" install
